// here we use counting 
// As we know the all characters have unique ASCII Value 
// we can count number of char/ascii values one by one from both string and compare them
// or first loop run on string , when it get char it add 1 to its position in arr of 256
// and 2nd loop run to decrease it by 1 when get char
// if it get empty array then it must be anagram
// TC - O(m+n) + O(256)
